# Axhilles

Static site for Axhilles, plus a mascot chat at `/chat`.

## Structure

- `index.html` — marketing page
- `styles.css` — alabaster / espresso / cobalt
- `script.js` — booking links, mobile nav
- `chat/` — mascot chat UI (`axhilles.com/chat`)
- `api/chat.js` — Vercel function; streams Claude Haiku 4.5 with `MASCOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- `api/lead.js` — lead form; summarises the transcript and emails Rahul
- `lib/` — prompts (as-is), placeholders, `saveLead`
- `scripts/verdict-test.mjs` — runs `VERDICT_TEST_CASES` against the mascot
- `spine/` — audit and finance workshop boards

## Running locally

The homepage is static:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Chat needs the API, so use Vercel:

```bash
npx vercel dev
```

Set secrets in `.env.local` (gitignored) or `vercel env add …`.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Chat + lead summary + verdict tests |
| `EMAIL_API_KEY` | Resend API key |
| `LEAD_EMAIL_TO` | `rahul@axhilles.com` |
| `LEAD_EMAIL_FROM` | `hello@axhilles.com` (must be a verified Resend domain) |

Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `/api/chat` returns “Chat is not configured yet.”

Leads are emailed with [Resend](https://resend.com). If the email fails, the lead is logged server-side (`LEAD_KEEP`) and the visitor still sees the confirmation.

## Placeholders

Edit `lib/placeholders.js` (and the matching constants at the top of `chat/chat.js`). Do not edit `lib/mascot-prompt.js`.

- `{{MASCOT_NAME}}`
- `{{BOOKING_LINK}}`
- `{{READING_LIST_LINK}}`
- `{{PRIVACY_URL}}` — also in `chat/index.html`

`BOOKING_LINK` is filled with the live Calendly URL so the handoff form can detect it. The others are still tokens.

## Verdict tests

Uses the API key and will spend tokens. From the repo root:

```bash
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/verdict-test.mjs
```

## Deploying

Push to `main`. Production is the Axhilles Vercel project (axhilles.com).

Add the environment variables on the Vercel project (Production + Preview). Chat is 10 messages per IP per ten minutes; lead form is 5 per IP per ten minutes. Conversations cap at about 30 messages, then the UI offers a handoff.
